**[Pathfinding Visualizer: Navigating Complex Terrains with Computer Vision](link)**

**Grade:** - 74%

This report was written as part of my Final Year Capstone Project, titled "The Pathfinding Visualizer," which details journey planning by employing computer vision to parse road map images and identify optimal travel routes. The system transforms road map images into binary forms, utilizing skeletonization to distill these images into minimalistic paths, identifying crucial intersections. Leveraging Dijkstra's and Depth First Search algorithms, the program calculates the shortest route between any two given points, showcased through a user-friendly interface. This innovative approach combines graph theory with advanced image processing to Create a pretty cool App!!!
